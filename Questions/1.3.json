The bandwidth is shared between all active users, so performance can decrease if there are too many users. \\n \\n Wireless networks are also less reliable than wired networks. Wired networks have a direct connection to the router or switch, whereas wireless networks are prone to obstruction such as walls and become slower the further you are from the switch/router.",
